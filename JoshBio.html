    <p>I'm Josh. I was born and raised in the Bronx, New York, but have lived in PA for over half of my life now. </p> 
<br>

<p>I've been teaching in higher education for the past 11 years but have recently decided to make a career change. 
    Before that, I taught high school for five years. My hobbies include reading, playing poker, and shooting pool. 
    And occasionally throwing a drink back. Nice to meet y'all!</p>
